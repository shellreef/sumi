Well, the head programmer posted a pretty good description of it on Slyck forums sometime ago. Basically it binds a dummy network interface with a fake IP address to your system and uses that on sends. I guess the searches and the necessary loopback traffic is proxied trough other PXP nodes. It's naturally based on UDP.

-edit- Found it so here's a quote from that post

    Quote: There is an alternative that doesn't use proxies but uses ip spoofing.

    1) Server sets up fake ip address (adds another address (fake) to its LAN adapter, easy to do). Does not require HDR_INCL TCP support.

>> or maybe, change the ip(?) ifconfig dummyif0 inet w.x.y.z netmask m.m.m.m up
>> But what is "HDR_INCL" TCP support??

    2) Server advertises its files to Supernode but Supernode stores 9 fake addresses along with one real address of Server

    3) Client finds file, and receives 10 addresses. Client requests large segment of file to all 10 addresses.

    4) Server answers request from fake ip address.

    5) Traffic control etc done by method similar to 3. Protocol is optimized to require as little backtraffic (client to server) as possible.

    5) Client never knows real ip address with certainty enough to file lawsuit, but gets file.

    Some people cannot ip spoof for various reasons, however, the large number that can ip spoof discredit ip addresses in the entire network. After suing a few innocent grandmothers and 5 year olds, attacker gives up.

    Theoretical? No, this is called PXP and is actually working on one particular P2P application.
