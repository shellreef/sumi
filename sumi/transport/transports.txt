Transports   2004-02-06 JC

SUMI is designed to be extensible and generic. Although the acronym stands for
"Spoofed UDP w/ Mediator of IRC", it has been conceived to replace both the 
spoofed UDP and IRC mediator with other means of communication. Basically, the
SUMI protocol requires two channels:
 One-way, anonymous to server, for sending small messages hopefully reliably
 One-way, anonymous to client, for sending bulk data possibly unreliably

Transports implement the small message covert channel. To make a transport:

def transport_init():      - sumiget will call this before doing anything
def sendmsg(id, msg):      - send a one-way message to a server identifier

Current transports:

modfake.py: Dummy
modirclib.py: Uses Python's own irclib (irclib.sf.net) module to communicate.
    Useful if you don't have an IRC client, or don't want to use it.
modmirc.py: Integrates with the Win32 mIRC program, see client-side/mirc.txt.
modxchat.py: Integrate with the Unix xchat program, see client-side/xchat.txt.
    Using this transport requires patching your xchat to accept SIGUSR2's.

Suggested transports:
modmute.py: TODO: use mute-net.sf.net's anonymous routing system
modaim.py: AOL Instant Messenger TODO: 2-way, and sumiserv
modgaim.py: Plugin for GAIM, so can use AIM, MSN, Y!, ICQ, IRC, etc.
 Note, gaim-remote won't suffice as it can only handle URIs. Requires plugin.
modwaste.py: Nullsoft WASTE. Uses IRC? TODO: talk to WASTE devs (Shared) (Eric)
modants.py: antsp2p.sf.net

TODO: Right now, sumiserv only does its own IRC. Extend this so it can use a
      transport here, and receive incoming messages as well as send messages.

Below is from an older file, integ.txt, which foreshadowed transports:
** mIRC Integration 20040120JC

"Remote", respond to IRC server events. For "error: " messages.
"Aliases", new commands

Transfer is client-initiated.
/sumi <nick> <file> ?

/sumi {
  # should tell sumiget.py to start a connection, receive cmd, send it
}

Use COM?

** xchat Integration 20040120JC
Perl can be embedded directly. Python if compiled for it.
~/.xchat/*.pl automatically loaded
xcsumi.pl

** GAIM Integration
Make a GAIM plugin..and while I'm at it, one for OTP
