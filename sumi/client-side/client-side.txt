Client Side Scripts   20040125JC

These scripts run in your transport client (mIRC, xchat, gaim, and so on). Not
to be confused with transport scripts, located in ../transports, which are
invoked by sumiget and are used to communicate with the transport client.
Client side scripts are used to execute sumiget from within your client, and
to print sumiget errors. They may also communicate with the transport.
