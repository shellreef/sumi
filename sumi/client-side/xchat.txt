Patching X-Chat to Allow Sending Commands from Other Processes 2004-02-16 JC?

Apply "xchat.c.patch" to xchat-1.8.11/src/common/xchat.c. This will add a few
lines that read an IRC command and execute it when SIGUSR2 is sent to the xchat
process. Just like how mIRC reads from an mmap'd file and executes it when it
receives WM_USER + 200.

After patching, recompile, and enjoy.

NOTE: Using shm would be nice, faster, no disk access.
