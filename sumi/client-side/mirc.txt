; So You Want to Use SUMI with mIRC?

; This tells you how. Go near the end of this file, starting with ";sumi".
; Copy and from there to the end (^C). Then open aliases.txt and paste
; (^V) at the end. Either go to C:\Program Files\mIRC\aliases.txt, or
; press Alt-R then go to the "Aliases" tab within mIRC.

; Note that the NSIS installer tries to do this for you if it detects mIRC.

; the "sumi-mirc 0.0" tag is required by the installer, if upgrading

; add this to aliases.ini:
;
;sumi-mirc 0.0
/sumi {
  if ($1 != get) {
    //echo SUMI: No such command $1
    return
  }
  //echo SUMI: Getting $3 from $2 ...
  run "C:\Program Files\SUMI\sumigetw" mirc $2 $3
}
