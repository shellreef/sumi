; So You Want to Use SUMI with mIRC?

; This tells you how. Go near the end of this file, starting with ";sumi".
; Copy and from there to the end (^C). Then open aliases.txt and paste
; (^V) at the end.

; (jc) this should be added if requested, by nsis installer
; HKLM 
;  "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\mIRC\UninstallString"
; if exists, then mIRC exists, can get mIRC folder with, then append to aliases
; the "sumi-mirc 0.0" tag is required by the installer, if upgrading

; add this to aliases.ini:
;
;sumi-mirc 0.0
/sumi {
  if ($1 != get) {
    //echo SUMI: No such command $1
    return
  }
  //echo SUMI: Getting $3 from $2 ...
  run "C:\Program Files\SUMI\sumigetw" mirc $2 $3
}
