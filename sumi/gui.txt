GUI Notes    Created:2004-02-22JC

BitTorrent has a nice GUI, also written in wxPython, could be partly based on
that. Or IE's download dialog. Statistics should be added, possibly on a 
separate tab, maybe like Azareus (BitTorrent-based) or whatever.

Upon reflection since 20040720, I think the tabbed listbox interface is the
best. BT's GUI is nice and simple, but has spawned clones with more 
informative interfaces. I'll still remain using wxWidgets and Python, just
like BitTorrent (a major inspiration for SUMI), to attain portability. The
GUI should have tabs for transfers, client and (when integrated) server conf.

Learn from BitTorrent. Bram created a simple GUI, but people still prefer
the complicated, though more featureful Azareus GUI.

As for the file icons, when applicable. sumiget and sumiserv can be sumo
wrestlers. Doing different things or facing different ways, receiving and
sending. Catching and throwing? For the files, baby sumi's?
