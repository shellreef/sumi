udpp2p is another project - 
http://udpp2p.sf.net/

$Id$

it mainly uses broadcasts, but a bug report on 
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=732045&group_id=76192&atid=547683 suggests:

"udp flow control
why not utilize another project for flow control
http://www.invisiblenet.net/iip/index.php
they focus on anonymous IRC but their goal is anonymous IP.
Send the bulk of the data via UDP and flow control with
IIP and presto large file anonymous sending"

This is what SUMI tries to do, though IIP is in some cases overkill

Seems that many people have similar ideas to SUMI.
