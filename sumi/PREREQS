$Id$

Eventually this should be made into a BSD port.

python >=2.4                Required since SUMI 0.4
py24-wxPython >= 2.6        If you want to run the sumigetw.py GUI
    (2.6 instead of 2.4 is required as of SUMI 0.8.13)
py24-cryptkit >= 0.9        If you want crypto
py24-pycrypto >= 2.0.1      If you want crypto
