<h2><a name="1">1. The Need for Anonymity</a></h2>
<p>Not discussed here.

<h2><a name="2">2. Source Address Spoofing</a></h2>
<p>The Internet is based on IP, the Internet protocol. This protocol is
packet-based. Any data that is sent has a source and destination IP address
attached to it, to allow routers to locate the destination as well as to 
allow the destination to send replies to the source. 

<p>Little known is that the majority of ISPs permit the source IP to be
faked (or forged, or spoofed) on outgoing packets. Often, the source address 
can be set to any address, even addresses not belonging to the ISP. This is
the feature that we will attempt to take advantage of in this document in
order to gain anonymity when transferring files. 

<p>Of course, if the source address is not real, then a "connection" cannot
be established because the destination host cannot send replies back to the
source. This basically rules out TCP. UDP, however, is connectionless by
nature. This makes UDP an ideal transport layer for sending packets with
spoofed source addresses. (ICMP or raw IP is also a possibility).

<h2><a name="3">3. Methods</a></h2>
<p>Several possibilities exist.

<h3><a name="3.1">3.1 Full-Duplex, Half-Anonymous: Trusted Hosts, Untrusted Network</a></h3>
<p>This method is best suited for when two trusted hosts wish to exchange
data without knowledge of the intermediate routers. (Note that the ISP's
routers directly connected to the hosts may or may not be able to identify 
them and locate which host is sending spoofed packets.) 

<p>The recipient and sender each know each other's IP addresses; they were
previously exchanged via a convent channel such as a PGP-encrypted email or
in person. The hosts agree on a common port or token for transfer. 
The sender sends
packets with spoofed source addresses to the recipient, and the recipient can
send packets with spoofed source addresses to the sender. Because both know
each other's address, they can send replies and communicate two-way, in full-
duplex mode. 

<p>Each host's address is revealed in the destination field; the recipient 
address is revealed in the destination field of packets sent by the sender,
and vice versa. Only the source IP is spoofed. For this reason, I call this
method "half-anonymous" -- the destination reveals both addresses, although
not at the same time. The two addresses have to be somehow linked together to
make any sense of the connection by a malicious sniffer. This may be possible
by taking note of half of the protocol coming from one host and half from
another. <i>Steganography</i> may help here by hiding within Internet
application protocols common on the Internet.

<p>Advantages:
<ul>
<li>Full-duplex two-way connection! May be possible to layer TCP over this.
<li>Difficult for intermediate routers to discover source &amp; dest
<li>Steganography
</ul>

<p>Disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>Both hosts must known each other's addresses
<li>Not anonymous from POV of a host (sender or recipient)
<li>Steganography
</ul>

<h3><a name="3.2">3.2. Half-Duplex, High-Anonymity for Sender</a></h3>
<p>In order to introduce anonymity into the system, we must introduce a 
concept known as "the network". This is a collection of peers that all know
about each other. Multiple networks may exist. The key to anonymity here is
that a request can be "broadcast" (sent to all hosts in the network) and 
replies can anonymously trickle in. The recipient send requests to multiple
senders, so in theory the sender cannot be determined. (The recipient can,
however, "scan" the network by sending requests to each host, one by one,
and waiting for a reply. This issue needs to be addressed, possibly by timing.)
The anonymity is gained by <i>camouflage</i>.

<p>Here's how this method works: the sender wants foobar.txt, so he broadcasts
a request asking for it (along with his maximum connection speed and other
parameters). Sender(s) then send bits of the file (with spoofed source 
addresses on the packets) to the recipient. This may be wasteful if more than
one host has the same file, although this allows for verification from other
senders. 

<p>(In order to reduce the number of replies, the recipient may include a
probability field. This field contains two numbers: a maximum limit, and a 
random number from 0 to the max. When potential senders receive the request
packet, they generate a random integer within the maximum limit, and if it is
equal to the given random number, they send the file. Otherwise, they ignore
the packet. Assuming the random integers are uniformally distributed, this
allows 100 senders to be cut down to 50 (max=1), 33 (max=2), 25 (max=3), etc.
New_sender_count = Total_senders / (Max + 1))

<p>Because senders never reveal their IP address, only the recipients do (to
the sender), this method is ideal where sharing is more dangerous than taking.
Sharers get nearly complete anonymity, while downloaders get none.

<p>The only types of communication that can occur in this setup are:
<ul>
<li>Broadcast: Recipient -> The Network (of senders)
<li>Malicious Scanning: Recipient -> Individual Sender
<li>Transfer: Recipient &lt- Sender
</ul>

<p>Advantages:
<ul>
<li>Sender IP is only revealed in the list of peers, not during transfer
</ul>

<p>Disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>All senders are revealed in the peer list (the network)
<li>Requesting from an individual sender and waiting for a reply may
    compromise anonymity
</ul>


<h3><a name="3.3">3.3. Half-Duplex, High-Anonymity for Recipient</a></h3>
<p>This is difficult, as far as I know it is not possible. The recipient
wants a file to be sent to him without the sender knowing his identity.
As far as I know this cannot be done because the sender must know the
recipient's address in order to send him data. Anonymous proxies are
a solution, but that is beyond the scope of this paper (the topic is 
UDP.)

<h3><a name="3.4">3.4. Half-Duplex, Full-Anonymity for Sender</a></h3>
<p>There is a way to achieve complete anonymity for the sender(s): eschew
the request packet. Instead, have the recipient(s) "join" a "group",
similar to the long-dead Audiogalaxy groups, if anyone remembers those. Files
will be sent out anonymously by the senders, whose addresses are kept secret 
(by the group registration interface -- which would probably be web-based 
and operated by a third party). The files will be sent at predetermined times,
the recipients may join at any time before the deadline. Their IPs are also
kept secret by the registrar.

<p>The registrar can be anonymized by going through proxies, but HTTP proxies
cannot serve. IRC may be the ideal medium, specifically, IRC with a virtual
host -- all text will be sent through the IRC server, and its address will
not be revealed. Sends can be scheduled and so on, untraceably. 
<a href="http://invisiblenet.net/">Invisible IRC Project</a> (IIP) is even
better, as DCC's are blocked at the server level. But networks that allow
custom vhosts, such as irc.p2pchat.net, may be sufficient (networks that 
remove unique info but not the domain, like irc.elite-irc.net, may do but
are not preferred). This introduces another trusted host into the system --
the IRC network, as well as the central registrar server. But maybe they can
be trusted (especially if its IIP).

<p>It may be possible to get some peer-to-peer action between the recipients,
but that may compromise anonymity if we know who is sending what.

<p>Advantages:
<ul>
<li><b>Senders totally anonymous to recipients</b>
<li>Recipients don't have to send a request
<li>Files can be sent as soon as available like AG groups
<li>... or they can be requested
<li>The mediator allows for a small, full-duplex control channel
</ul>

<p>Disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>A mediator is required, such as on IIP IRC (small disadvantage)
</ul>

<h2><a name="4">4. Introducing SUMI</a></h2>
<p>SUMI, Spoofed UDP with Mediator of IRC, is a protocol implementing
method #4, providing full anonymity for the sender. The sender's address is
never revealed.

<p>The network uses two channels:
<ul>
<li><b>IRC</b>: A two-way, anonymous, slow channel requiring a third party
<li><b>UDP</b>: A one-way, anonymous, fast, unreliable channel
</ul>
<p>IRC can be anonymous when the IRC network is trusted, and users cannot
/whois users to find their IP address or hostname. 
<a href="http://invisiblenet.net/">IIP</a> is one such IRC network. Other
networks let you set your own vhost or obfuscate your hostname for you, these
may be sufficient. The IRC channel is used for negotiation between the
recipient and the sender, as well as control information. It is the only way
the recipient (client) can communicate with the sender (server).

<p>The UDP channel is one-way; the server sends to the client datagrams with
spoofed source addresses. Note that this is not entirely untraceable; Chinese
may want to avoid using SUMI and instead stick to IIP directly. At the expense
of anonymity from the intermediate routers, SUMI provides greater speed as well
as anonymity of the sender to the recipient.

<h3><a name="4.1">4.1. Handshake and Negotiation</a></h3>
<p>The IRC channel is used for handshake and MSS negotation. 
A client wanting a file sends
a private message to a sender, containing the following:
<pre>
sumi send <i>Filename</i>\t<i>Offset</i>\t<i>Addr</i>\t<i>Port</i>\t
<i>MSS</i>\t<i>Prefix</i>\t<i>Latency</i>
</pre>
<p>Each field is separated by a tab (\t).
<ul>
<li><b>Filename</b>: This can either be a complete filename, or a number like
#1, #2, etc. as common with <a href="http://iroffer.com/">iroffer</a>. Spaces
are definitely allowed; the only thing that isn't is tabs and newlines.
<li><b>Offset</b>: Resume offset. Not yet used; may not be complete.
<li><b>Addr</b>: IP address of the client that wants the file.
<li><b>Port</b>: UDP port the client is listening on for file transfer.
<li><b>MSS</b>: Maximum Segment Size, modelled after the TCP concept of the 
same name. The UDP MSS is 12 bytes larger than the TCP MSS due to 12 fewer
bytes in the UDP header. Sender will send datagrams this size. Minimum 256.
<li><b>Prefix</b>: Random three bytes base-64 encoded, generated by client.
Client should keep track of this, the sender will send it back.
<li><b>Latency</b>: In microseconds, time sender should wait before sending
each packet. Should match but not exceed download bandwidth.
</ul>

<p>Upon receiving the send request packet (above), the sender sends a UDP
packet of size MSS to the specified IP and port, on port 65535, with the 
following payload:
<pre>
<i>prefix</i> <i>seqno</i> <i>data</i>
</pre>
<p>The prefix is 3 bytes, and is what the client sent to the sender (base64
decoded). Next (without any spaces) is the one-byte sequence number, which is
set to 0 in this case. The remainder of the packet (of size MSS requested by
the client) is pseudo-random data. The UDP source port number is used for
the upper 16 bits of the sequence number, and 65535 means 0 (since port 0 is
not easily sent from); thus, the authentication packet has a sequence number of
0 (the lower 8 bits of the sequence number are in the packet itself).

<p>The client receives this packet and checks for the prefix it requested.
Packets without the prefix are dropped. This is done to make sure that the
spoofed UDP packet really came from the same sender as communiciated through
via IRC, and not some malicious entity. Essentially, it verifies the server
to the client.

<p>If all goes well, the client can send an authenticate
message via IRC private message to the server:
<pre>
sumi auth <i>MSS</i>\t<i>Hash</i>
</pre>
<p>The MSS is the size of the authentication packet the sender sent. It may
be less than the MSS the client requested (minimum 256 bytes), and the client 
should make note of
this as this new MSS will be used for file transfer. The hash is a base64-
encoded MD5 hash of the entire payload of the UDP authentication packet.

<p>The server receives the hash and hashes the substring of MSS bytes of the
packet it sent, and compares it to the hash sent by the client. If it matches,
the client is verified to by the server, and the spoofed UDP channel is good;
the client specified a valid IP and port number.
The sender now sends a start message via IRC:
<pre>
sumi start <i>Filename</i>\t<i>Offset</i>\t<i>FileSize</i>
</pre>

<p>Following this initial handshake, both hosts are authenticated, and a 
terse, compact protocol is used to speed up communication over the secure
channel. The client sends a single "k", ac<b>k</b>nowledging the sumi start,
and the sender can begin sending.

<h3><a name="4.2">File Transfer</a></h3>
<p>TFTP-ish reliability mechanism: require the client to send an 
acknowledgement (through IRC) for each packet, before the sender sends the
next packet. This is inefficient but works; if sender doesn't receive an 
acknowledgement after a certain time, the sender re-send's the offending
datagram. In my tests with a small file and Ethernet window size, this allows
for about 1.5KB/s with 16,000 bytes. Not very good. Latency of the IRC server
limits latency on the UDP channel. Packets are acknowledged with k<i>seqno</i>
from client to sender; when sender gets this packet he sends <i>seqno</i>+1.

<p>Client knows last packet because its length is smaller than the MSS.
(Implementation note: if the last packet is equal to the MSS in length, send
an empty packet, with proper prefix and seqno of course. The client won't
write any data to disk but will know the end of the file is there.)

<p>Something better needs to be implemented, similar to TCP. Flow control
through a sliding window,
minimized acknowledgements, retransmissions. We already have sequence numbers
for ordering, and in fact, this is one advantage SUMI has over TCP: not all
packets have to be received to receive more; that is, packets can arrive at
any time and be put in their place. TCP is a streaming protocol. SUMI doesn't
have to be, and can take advantage of this.

<p>Instead of k<i>seqno</i>, to request the next packet, client may send
k<i>seqno</i>\t<i>RWIN</i>\t<i>delay</i> (RWIN = receive window) to request 
<i>RWIN</i> packets, optionally with a delay of <i>delay</i> ns before each.
These packets are acknowledged with a single line, but instead of k, n is used
for negative acknowledgement and packets that didn't reach are listed,
separated by commas.
