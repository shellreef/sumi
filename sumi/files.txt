Files not included in archive, because they can be generated easily:

build/ dist/ incoming/ share/ otp/ 
*.pyc *.o
launch/launch
c++-obsolete/sender
c++-obsolete/sumiserv
hash/mddriver
hash/test
rawproxd

Note: build/ and dist/ are from py2exe. Run setup.py py2exe to use it.
The McMillian Installer also works. Generate a spec file with options
--icon sumi.ico sumigetw.py, and pass it to build.py--it will give you an exe.
