Crypto in SUMI 20040218

* DONE Pre-auth encryption, so covert (optional) + data chan can be encrypted. This
  way the IP can be encrypted, so IRC net doesn't need to encrypt and IRC
  admins can't track; only UDP spoofers can. (Also it will encrypt prefix, so
  the UDP stream cannot be associated with it easily.)
  pycrypto: http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto.html pycrypto.sf.net
   ezpycrypto, yawpycrypto.sf.net

* TODO Public key encryption.  RSA/DSA/El Gamal. GnuPG has minimium 768-bit
  keysize = 192 bytes, which isn't too bad.


pycrypto has: (/usr/ports/security/py-pycrypto)

    * Hash functions: MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA, HAVAL RIPEMD.
    * Block encryption algorithms: AES, ARC2, Blowfish, CAST, DES, Triple-DES, IDEA, RC5, Sapphire
    * Stream encryption algorithms: ARC4, simple XOR.
    * Public-key algorithms: RSA, DSA, ElGamal, qNEW.
m2crypto has these too (/usr/ports/security/py-m2crypto), and SSL

Any of the symmetric encryptions can be used. Identifiers for future:
 Hash:       md2 md4 md5 sha haval ripemd
 Symmetric:  aes arc2 bf cast des 3des idea rc5 sapphire arc4 xor otp
 Public-key: rsa dsa elg qnew
(Most of these are from PyCrypt, but not otp). TODO: switch from CryptKit to
PyCrypto.

When implemented, this should be done pre-auth (sumi sec <type> <key>). Could
be a problem to exchange large keys as required with public-key algorithms.
Might be able to send as multiple messages. (And ack's should be compressed.)
