wt2db is made up of a Perl module (Wt2Db.pm) and a small wrapper script
(wt2db), so it can be called from the command line or used in your Perl
program. Therefore, it is installed like a Perl module. Installing the
Perl module will also install the wrapper script into /usr/bin.

To install the Perl module, run:

	perl Makefile.PL

That will generate a Makefile. Then, run:

	make

to build the package, and run:

	make test

to convert a small, arbitrary bit of WikiText. If the output looks
like DocBook, go ahead and run:

	make install

as root to copy the files to the appropriate locations.
