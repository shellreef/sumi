I will be using this new Wiki for documenting SUMI. For those not familiar with Wikis, anyone can edit the pages to improve on them, ask questions, etc. Feel free to do so. \endNode{}

{3}}I've moved from [http://sourceforge.net/ SourceForge] to the excellent [http://developer.berlios.de/ BerliOS] host for this Wiki. There shouldn't be many noticeable changes, except: it should be faster (MySQL on SF is very overloaded and slow), and the "Mail me a new password" link now works. Special thanks to BerliOS for allowing SUMI to be hosted here. Enjoy the Wiki! -\/-\/\Node%
