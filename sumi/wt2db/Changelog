2005-01-22	1.0	Declared 1.0 since no bugs files in forever.

			Updated XML DTD to 4.3

2002-05-19	0.6	Updated documentation.

			Removed wget call to retrieve ldp namespace.
			This really doesn't belong in a general purpose utility.

			Encoded [[link:foo]] as <xref/> instead of <xref></xref>.

			Encoded "Q: Foo?" as:
				<question id='foo'>
				  <para id='foo-title'>Foo?</para>
				</question>
			instead	of:
				<question>
				  <para>Foo?</para>
				</question>
			This was causing our xrefs to become:
				<a href="foo"><p>Bar</p></a>
			which  causes ugly line breaks in the final output.
			
			Added -f, --faq option to generate the article tag as:
				<article class='faq'>

			Added processing instruction:
				<? dbhtml toc='1' ?>
			so each <qandaset> gets its own list of questions.

			Fixed wiki links -- spaces in URLs are now correctly
			replaced with underscores.

			Fixed bug where lines ending in \x0a aren't chomped.

			Added support for ftp:// and news:// links.

			Added support for <appendix> tags.

2002-06-25	0.5	Switched -V and -v, now -v is version, -V is verbose.
			
			Changed -a, --article to -x, --xml and -s, --sgml to
			let you pick your own doctype.

			Added -n, --nonet parameter to disable network
			lookups.

			Fixed bug in screen blocks, para tags were being
			closed when not open.

			Deleted [ for <filename>, added [[file:]] namespace instead.
			This is less likely to generate false positives.
			
			[[ is now for internal links and become <xref>.

			Encoding of literal block tags into entities.

			Added -e, --encoding to specify encoding.            

			Added [[dir:foo]] for directories.

			Added [[dev:foo]] for device files.

			Added ability to nest ordered lists and itemized lists
			up to four levels deep, mix-and-match.

			"#" and "*" for lists no longer have to be in the first column.

			Added XML ISO Entity reference.

2002-05-24	0.4	Added -a, --article option.
	    		This option wraps the document content in <article>
	    		tags, and prefixes the file with a DocBook 4.1.2
	    		DOCTYPE declaration.

			Added <articleinfo> as a literal section, so a user
			can write their own meta-data when not using
			Lampadas and still get a complete DocBook file.

2002-05-01	0.3	Initial public release.
