For wt2db bugs and development plans, see the 
Lampadas project's wt2db component in the Gnome Bugzilla database,
http://bugzilla.gnome.org. Lampadas is not part of Gnome,
but Gnome is a very kind supporter and sponsor of Lampadas,
and provides this generous service to us.

I use this TODO file as a place to jot quick TODO notes for
myself. Eventually, they need to be ported over into Bugzilla,
once I have a good idea what it is I want to do and can
properly articulate it as a "bug report" or "feature request".


TODO Items
----------

Add table support. See the implementation done in TWiki:
http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/TWikiShorthand
This may be a good format to follow -- it's pretty simple
and sensible, and it looks like it would be very
extensible as well.

Add the ability to specify include files.
