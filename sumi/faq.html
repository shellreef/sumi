<h1>SUMI FAQ</h1>

<h2>How does SUMI work?</h2>
<p>SUMI uses a covert channel for client-to-server communication to keep
the address of the server secret (on IRC), and a faster spoofed UDP channel
for server-to-client data transfer. Both channels are required to successfully
transmit data with flow control and retransmissions. It should also be possible
in the future to use other transmission mechanisms.

<h2>What OS do I have to have to run SUMI?</h2>
<p>For a client, any OS should be sufficient (see next question).

<p>For a server, you need to have either: a) a Unix system with root
access, or b) a Windows XP/2000 or better system. Either of these setups
will allow raw sockets required for IP source address spoofing. In particular,
Windows NT, Me, 98, 95, and 3.11 will not work with sumiserv. (Note to self:
Winpcap has a pcap_send function that supposedly works on these OS's.)
With Unix, if
your sysadmin is kind enough to set the setuid bit on "launch" and change 
ownership to root, you should be able to run SUMI by typing this command as
a normal user: <tt>launch ./sumiserv</tt>. This is recommended for security
purposes, as the actual sumiserv will not be run as root; rather launch will
create a raw socket, and pass it to sumiserv. (launch is unavailable on
Win32 because of the lack of socket.fromfd.)

<p>Setting dchan_mode to "pcap" may work on Me, 98, and 95, but this is
currently experimental. Currently it fails with <tt>ImportError: DLL load
failed: One of the library files needed to run this application cannot
be found</tt> because of a missing mfc42u.dll (Microsoft Foundation Works
4.2 Unicode version), which is not available for non-NT OS's.
Windows 95 users will need a

95 WinSock 2 Update</a> from Microsoft.

<h2>Why does SUMI use UDP by default, instead of another protocol such as ICMP?</h2>
<p>ICMP offers a distinct advantage over all other protocols: an ICMP echo
request can be sent with a spoofed source address to any pingable host on
the Internet, and an echo reply will be forwarded, with the original data, back
to the spoofed source address. ICMP allows nearly any host to be a proxy.
Win32 raw sockets allow receiving echo replies. 

<p>UDP will be dropped by some routers under heavy load in favor of TCP
packets. Routers may form TCP "aggregates" and forward them, which may or may
not be possible with UDP. (?)

<p>However, using UDP has several advantages over any other protocol. Systems 
not able to handle raw sockets (Windows Me, 98, 95, NT, 3.11) or users not
able to create raw sockets (anything but root on normal Unix systems) can
still receive the packets. Most TCP/IP stacks can only receive TCP or UDP
without special priviledges (the exception is WinXP/2K). Portability is
important; anyone should be able to receive these packets.

<p>However, in the future it may be an option to use ICMP or spoofed TCP
if the client is able to. Receiving TCP packets will require libcap, and care
has to be taken to not have the OS interfere with attempting to establish
a TCP connection. (SUMI can't use TCP provided by the OS because TCP is a
connection-oriented service, see the next question).

<h2>What is the "ICMP Echo" data channel type?</h2>
<p>An ICMP echo request is sent (by the server) from a source address of
the client, to a random pingable host. The host's kernel receives the ping,
swaps the source and destination, and sends an echo reply with the same 
payload. Therefore the client receives an ICMP echo reply from the gateway
with the server's data in it. 

<p>However, ICMP echo mode is often slow and inefficient. An extraordinarly
small MSS may have to be used, and the extra host introduces more latency and
packet losses.

<h2>What does SUMI use to ensure file transfers are not corrupted?</h2>
<p>As of 0.8.9, all UDP packets SUMI sends include a UDP checksum. If the
data is corrupted, the checksums won't match, the packet will be discarded
by the OS, and the SUMI transfer protocol will request resending it.

<h2>How does SUMI differ from TCP?</h2>
<p>SUMI's file transfer protocol and TCP have much the same goal:
reliability, guaranteed order, retransmissions. However, there are some
subtle differences. Of course, SUMI's data packets can be spoofed which is not
possible with TCP.

<p>In SUMI, a client-to-server messages have high-latency. The message has
to travel to the IRC server, and the IRC server has to send it to the final
destination. For this reason, client-to-server acknowledgements must be
minimized as much as possible; and therefore a acknowledgement mechanism
similar to TCP's own "selective acknowledgements" (see 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2018.txt">RFC2018</a>) is used. Only the
sequence numbers of missing packets are transmitted. Additionally, the window
size is transmitted with each acknowledgement, implicitedly acknowledging all
packets not listed as successfully received. SUMI has a window, although it
does not (yet) "slide" as TCP's does.

<p>Fortunately, the server-to-client channel has about the same bandwidth and
latency as it would with TCP. In this regard, SUMI is asymmetric. TCP uses
the same channel for both directions, SUMI uses UDP for data (server to client)
and IRC for error control (client to server).

<p>SUMI has some advantages, however. TCP is and has always been a stream
protocol. SUMI is not. Thousands of packets can be sent; and any one can be
missed and data can continue flowing. The missed packets can be resent later.
The file doesn't have to be received as one contigious whole, although it must
be in order. Sequence numbers take care of that.

<h2>Is SUMI more efficient than TCP?</h2>
<p>Probably not. Its true that SUMI allows 8 bytes more of payload (due to
IP's header of 20, TCP's header of 20, UDP's header of 8, and SUMI's header
of 4), but this is hardly significant. TCP has been highly optimized over the
years and sophisticated algorithms have been developed using Nagle's algorithm,
slow start, silly window avoidance, Van Jacobson algorithm, and others. SUMI
does not have this maturity, although it doesn't try to be less efficient than
TCP.

<h2>What if I can't IP spoof?</h2>
<a href="ftp://ftp.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2827.txt">RFC2827</a> describes egress and
ingress filtering suggested as the way to stop IP spoofing. The most legitimate
concern for stopping IP spoofing is to stop DoS attacks. However, this also
influences SUMI because SUMI servers spoof their source address to remain
more anonymous. You may still be in luck.

<p>Dial-in users and other point-to-point users most likely cannot spoof their
IP. Its easy to verify at the dial-up point. Cable and DSL users may have an
easier time. You may be able to spoof your IP to have a valid prefix (the same
as your real IP), but a ever-changing unique host number. This varies depending
on the size of your subnet, but RFC2827 says it well:
<blockquote>
   As mentioned previously, while ingress traffic filtering drastically
   reduces the success of source address spoofing, it does not preclude
   an attacker using a forged source address of another host within the
   permitted prefix filter range. It does, however, ensure that when an
   attack of this nature does indeed occur, a network administrator can
   be sure that the attack is actually originating from within the known
   prefixes that are being advertised. This simplifies tracking down the
   culprit, and at worst, the administrator can block a range of source
   addresses until the problem is resolved.
</blockquote>
<p>An example would be "204.69.207.0/24". You could spoof the last octet to
help obfuscate your source. (Note that this RFC is directed towards preventing
IP spoofing <i>attacks</i>. SUMI is not an attack.)

<p>ICMP proxying can help obfuscate your source further in face of egress
filtering, although it is can be inefficient.

<p>Another filter ISPs may impose is blocking internal address they own 
coming in to their network. The server can easily circumvent this by not
spoofing the IP to have the prefix as the client. If the client and server
are within the same prefix, behind the filtering router, any spoofing may
occur.

<p>Other <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~rmeijer/spoofing.html">spoofing
prevention techniques</a> exist, although some are impractical.

<p>CERT says this in <a href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1998-01.html">
CA-1998-01</a>:
<blockquote>
Attacks like the smurf attack rely on the use of forged packets, that is, packets for which the attacker deliberately falsifies the origin address. With the current IP protocol technology, it is impossible to eliminate IP-spoofed packets. However, you can use filtering to reduce the likelihood of your site's networks being used to initiate forged packets.
</blockquote>

In spite of all this, plenty of ISPs still allow source address spoofing,
using <i>any</i> source address. (Private IP addresses may be dropped by
other routers, however.) One way to find out is to try running a SUMI server
and having your friend connect using the SUMI recipient software. If you get
a warning saying possible IP spoofing failure, your ISP may filter. Many 
still do not however.

<h2>Assuming I can spoof any address, what addresses should I not spoof?</h2>
<p>(See the previous question for how to determine if you can.)

<p><a href="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1918.txt">RFC1918</a> says:
<blockquote><pre>
   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the
   following three blocks of the IP address space for private internets:

     10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)
     172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix)
     192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)</pre>
</blockquote>

<a href="http://minwoo.jeong.or.kr/openbsd/securing_small_networks_with_OBSD.html">An ipfilter tutorial</a> blocks these addresses outgoing:
<blockquote><pre>
block out quick on tun0 from any to 192.168.0.0/16
block out quick on tun0 from any to 172.16.0.0/12
block out quick on tun0 from any to 127.0.0.0/8
block out quick on tun0 from any to 10.0.0.0/8
block out quick on tun0 from any to 0.0.0.0/8
block out quick on tun0 from any to 169.254.0.0/16
block out quick on tun0 from any to 192.0.2.0/24
block out quick on tun0 from any to 204.152.64.0/23
block out quick on tun0 from any to 224.0.0.0/3
</pre></blockquote>

<p>127/8 is the loopback, 0/8 is used to refer to "this" network,
169.254/16 is the link-local block, 192.0.2/24 is "TEST-NET", 204.152.64/23
is reserved for private Sun servers, and 224/3 is Class D and Class E. SUMI
has the is_nonroutable function to test for these addresses and discards them.

<h2>Are there any file size limits?</h2>
<p>Yes. The maximum file size depends on your MTU. It can be calculated as
follows: (MTU - 32) * 16777216. It varies from 8GB to 12GB depending on
your MTU; this should be enough for anybody. If its not, you can always split
the file. (Note: if the file size limitation becomes too much of a problem,
I'd be willing to consider changing the protocol to allow for larger files.)

<h2>How can I be anonymous on my covert channel?</h2>
<p>For IRC, you have several options:
<p>Use a network that supports the +x mask, or automatically provides hostname
masking. The major networks do not usually provide this but the smaller ones
may. Note that there are several levels of masking; the best replace your host
with a seemingly-random series of characters (a hash, actually) not revealing
any information about you; next best masks all but your last two domains (thus
revealing your ISP); next best mask only the first domain, revealing your ISP
and possibly location (if your ISP encodes that in their client's hostnames).
The worst IRC networks, anonymity-wise, reveal your full hostname, leaving you
vulnerable to IRC viruses as well as defeating the purpose of SUMI.

<p>A few networks let you create a "virtual host" or vhost, that replaces your
real mask. Some networks require an administrator to create one for you, which
they may not be willing to do; it is also cumbersome especially for your users.
Better networks provide an automated or semi-automated vhost registration 
system, possibly available from NickServ or #vhost.

<p>A bouncer is also an option but provides less security if your bnc host is
not trustworthy. Bouncer shell operators may be susceptable to social 
engineering even if their box is completely secure.

<p>An option not available to most is changing your reverse DNS after
connecting. The majority of clients most likely will not be able to do this, 
but in some situations it could be useful. Change your reverse DNS to something
bogus, connect, and then change it again if desired.

<h2>What encryption should I use?</h2>
<p>SUMI ensures anonymity of the sender--untrackability of its IP address, as 
much as possible. However, anonymity doesn't guarantee that the data cannot
be intercepted and read (although the source cannot be traced). If your data
is not sensitive, the transfer will be the fastest if no crypto is used.
Sensitive data has the option of being encrypted with several algorithms.

<p><b>Symmetric encryption</b> is most secure when the covert channel is
encrypted. The IIP project provides this security, as do SSL IRC servers but
SSL-IRC may be interceptable by the server administrator(s). SUMI currently
uses the AES (Rijndeal) block cipher and it is relatively fast. The covert 
channel is used to send a 256-bit key, with which the file is encrypted with
prior to transmission.

<p><b>One-time pad</b> encryption is unbreakable. There is a catch: a file
(preferably on CD or DVD) needs to be securely be possessed by both the sender
and recipient. The file must be at least the length of all the files to be
transferred, and the data must be as random as possible.
<a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/">Ent</a> can be used to verify the
entropy, <a href="http://www.random.org/">random.org</a> and 
<a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/">Hotbits</a> can provide small
quantities of random numbers from atomospheric noise and radioactive decay,
respectively. Large quantities can also be self-generated. OTP
is the best method for highly sensitive data. (NOT YET SUPPORTED)

<p><b>Asymmetric public-key encryption</b> does not require an encrypted 
covert channel but the public keys need to be exchanged. This is a good general
method, as in theory the IP of the recipient, and all covert data, can be 
encrypted before authenticating, revealing nothing to know one. However SUMI
has NOT YET IMPLEMENTED this.

<h2>On Windows 95/98/Me, I get the error <tt>ImportError: DLL load failed: One
of the library files needed to run this application cannot be found.</tt>
when running sumiserv using dchan_mode of "pcap", why?</h2>
<p>This cryptic error most likely means sumiserv is using the wrong versions of
one or more of npptools.dll, packet.dll, wpcap.dll, or wanpacket.dll (part
of WinPcap), particularly, Unicode DLLs. NPPTools.dll depends on mfc42u.dll,
which is not available for Windows Me. (Unicode is not supported.) 

<p>To fix this problem, ensure npptools.dll, packet.dll, wpcap.dll, and 
wanpacket.dll are not in C:\Program Files\SUMI. Try re-running sumiserv,
and if the same error occurs, reinstall WinPcap.
