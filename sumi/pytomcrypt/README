PyTomCrypt -- a Python wrapper for LibTomCrypt

$Id$

First you need to build LibTomCrypt with -fPIC. Then run make build.

If you get this error:

	ld: /usr/local/lib/libtomcrypt.a(aes.o): relocation R_X86_64_32S can 
	not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
	/usr/local/lib/libtomcrypt.a: could not read symbols: Bad value

You need to recompile LibTomCrypt with -fPIC. Neither the FreeBSD ports nor
packages or the main distribution include -fPIC because it requires a register,
and on register-starved machines the performance hit is significant. (~10%)

Unfortunately -fPIC is required for shared libraries on amd64 by gcc, and
as far as I can tell SWIG requires building shared libraries.

says:

AFAIK, AMD64 pretty much across the board requires you to inject -fPIC
into every compilation. Probably wouldn't be a bad thing to add to the
build system.
