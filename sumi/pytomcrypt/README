PyTomCrypt -- a Python wrapper for LibTomCrypt

$Id$

First you need to build LibTomCrypt with -fPIC. I had to also define 
LTC_NO_ASM to get it to build properly on amd64. Then run make build.

ld: /usr/local/lib/libtomcrypt.a(aes.o): relocation R_X86_64_32S can not be
used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC

AFAIK, AMD64 pretty much across the board requires you to inject -fPIC
into every compilation. Probably wouldn't be a bad thing to add to the
build system.
