You are in the directory for the Perl version of SUMI, which only lasted
for one revision (0.1), through 20030402 to 20030803. This was the initial
prototype of SUMI which laid the groundwork for later versions and proved
the idea of spoofed transfer with a mediator was feasiable. 

Requires perl5.
