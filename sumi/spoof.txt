Spoofing Capabilities     2003-08-03 JC

Major ISPs:
"ISPs and major backbones don't effectively prevent bogon (unallocated and unannounced) IP space from traversing the wide Internet. Therefore a hacker with minimal sophistication can attack you from IP addresses that don't exist."
"As far as a technical solution, Tier-1 providers and local ISPs need to filter traffic. If you are using 68.78.10.0/24 and the IPs in the packet headers leaving your network are from something else, your configuration is broken. All the suddenly spoofed packets can be located to within a Class C."

Vixie's solutions to DDoS:

 	Each peer agrees to emit only IP packets with accurate
	source addresses, to require their customers to do likewise,
	and to extend this requirement to all other peers by $DATE.


A very similar idea to SUMI:
 http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1017118&forum_id=283651
Update: egress filtering is also known as RPF. It may be more widely
 implemented with time as DDoS attacks continue.
http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/2/4/101948/6201 is one of many
http://ddos-ca.org/ Distributed Denial of Service - Class Action Lawsuit
 "attacks can be traced if you get a tier1 provider to start looking. I know 
  the one I work for will trace attacks for customers, if they are going to 
  press charges, and will trace attacks that originate from our network if
  another tier1 calls and has traced a live attack to us." -- applies to SUMI?
Unicast RPF: google:rpf filtering
 - Checks IP packet source address against CEF table and discards if !rev-path
 - Interface command: ip verify unicast reverse-path
 - Requires Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF)
 - IOS 11.1(17)CC CEF 13 & 12.0 (not 11.2 and 11.3)
* RPF needs to be done at the edges of the trust boundary, not the 1st hop rtr
^ this means all within the "trust boundary" IPs are allowed

Interesting point: if you connect a switch to your DSL/cable modem, you may
be able to have two computers with two routable, public IP addresses. This
works with Verizon. This may not work with ISPs that require authentication.

Very clever indeed - I thought of this too; they have a /16 mask.

Verizon 
- allows full spoofing, even of unrouteable IPs (10.0.0.0) within the network
  as well as spoofing outside the network (tried to Comcast), the 768/128
  and 1500/128 are equally spoofable but the former gets about 14.5KB/s,
  while the later gets around 16.5KB/s. /22

MSN Dialup (*.rasserver.net aka ICGCom(?))
- allows spoofing (tried 1.2.3.4)

Comcast Cable
- /16 subnet, /24 works, /20
xxxx-xxxx.xxxx-xxxx.0100-1110 (78) - NO
xxxx-xxxx.xxxx-xxxx.0100-1101 (77) - yes
xxxx-xxxx.xxxx-xxxx.0100-1001 (73) - yes
xxxx-xxxx.xxxx-xxxx.0100-1000 (72) - NO

Juno Dialup
- allows spoofing (tried 41.0.0.0, 35.72.0.0, 144.95.0.0, ...)
- 1.2.3.4:5, port remains intact

Shaw Cable
- 1.2.3.4 doesn't work,
  24.108.44.142. Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
  Use, for example allow: 24.108.44.142/24

TeleStar/AOL(CompuServ) - satellite
- doesn't work?

AOL Dialup
- fails on 1.2.3.4:5
Comcast
- rumored to egress filter. they do NetBIOS filtering
- subnet: 255.255.255.0
- didn't work, even with own IP(!) in one case

Dial-Up ISPs
- rumored to have most of them filter, since its point-to-point (PPP)
Source: http://www.megasecurity.org/trojans/skydance/Skydance3.6.html
"In addition to that MOST ISPs DO FILTER SPOOFED PACKETS OF DIAL IN COMPUTERS
 ANYWAY!"

PacBell
- rumored to have PPPoE, which is rumored to be common with DSL
