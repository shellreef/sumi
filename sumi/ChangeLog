2005-09-07 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Installer runs uninstaller if an old version already exists (#1284284)
	* Don't include old HTML documentation with distribution; latest docs
	  are on wiki and should eventually be converted and distributed with SUMI

2005-09-06 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added doc/wdoc.py to extract articles from SUMIWiki, pipe to wt2db
	* In server, if 'interface' is blank, autoselect using use_new_if(),
	  correcting "Pcap: Error opening : pcapy.PcapError" (thanks peersurfer)

	* Added a few doctests
	* SUMI is listed on Slyck.com!
	* This is a source-only release; there are only minor changes from
	  the 0.8.13 binary Win32 release. 

2005-09-01 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourcforge.net> - 0.8.13

2005-08-31 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>

2005-08-29 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Add support for passing a .sumi filename to sumigetw
	* New .sumi file format
	* GUI "Resume" works on multiple transfers at once
	* Installer compressed with LZMA solid
		Default compresion: 4493015, vs. LZMA solid: 3330921
	  Without WinPcap, it is the smallest sumiinst of the 0.8 series
	* WinPcap 3.1 is now bundled with the installer
	* Installer sets up file associations

2005-08-25 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>

2005-08-22 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>
	* sumigetw uses wxPython 2.6.1.0 and new-style symbol names, no more 2.4
	* Client configures MTU instead of MSS, make MSS not include header
	* Fix sumigetw crash after 30,000 characters were logged, add log files

2005-08-21 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net> - 0.8.12
	* New transport: modtor, uses The Onion Router (see http://tor.eff.org)
	* File data encryption fully works, enabled by default (crypt_req not)
	* Many minor bugfixes, removed modpipe, use shorter variable names ('u')

2005-08-11 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Partially autoconfigure IP, MSS, src_allow, and interface if
	  no 'interface' in config.py or no 'src_allow' in sumiserv.cfg.

2005-08-10 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>
	* General code cleanup (pychecker again)
	* NAK lost packets are compressed, ex: 1-5,8,10 instead of 1,2,3,..

2005-07-31 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net> - 0.8.11
	* Auth packet includes hash of nonce for client to verify
	* Completely redone crypto implementation from 0.8.10
	* Use SHA-1 for key derivation function as recommended
	* Changed MD5 to SHA-1 in auth packet (MD5 still used for rawproxd)
	* Added INTERLOCK_DELAY; a time-sensitive enhancement to the Interlock
	  Protocol in order to detect some MITM

2005-07-23 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Request messages can now be encrypted, set "crypto" to "y"
	* EC-DH + interlock protocol for key exchange/request
	* AES-256 for symmetric encryption 
	* Protects against passive eavesdropping and active MITM (not hijack)
	* Works well, but incomplete--need to verify nonce, encrypt data

2005-07-14 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Removed cryptography for now--needs to be redone.

2005-07-08 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Use log() instead of print in client, server, and transports
	* sumiget logs to "Client" tab, now works

	* Added 'noise' option to allow simulated packet loss
	* sumigetw now runs sumiserv in "Server" tab

2005-07-02 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net> - 0.8.10
	* sumiserv send_packet_UDP_PCAP tested and now works on Windows Me
	* WinPcap DLLs removed from distribution--install separately instead
	  (fixes missing DLL problem on Me)
	* added server_udp_PCAP to receive UDP packets using WinPcap in
	  sumiget, added dchanmode to config.py
	* Fixed problem with ICMP unreachable ports (generated by OS) when
	  using pcap mode.

2005-06-20 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net> - 0.8.9
	* source release only

2005-06-19 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>
	* fixed UDP checksum; now works on BSD, Windows, raw & data-link

2005-06-18 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>
	* sumiserv uses transports (irclib and aim currently functional)
	  now instead of relying on IRC
	* all IRC-specific code in sumiserv moved to irclib transport
	* aim transport can receive messages, thanks to pcapy
	* a modified pcapy can send raw link-layer frames using WinPcap
	* send_packet_UDP_WINPCAP is an alternate way to send UDP packets;
	  it can also spoof the Ethernet addresses--this method may allow
	  sumiserv to serve via UDP on Windows 95/98/Me (not tested)
	* send_frame_ETHER added
	* UDP checksums finally added; should reduce possibily of corruption

2004-09-09 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net> - 0.8.8

	  sumiserv should now run compiled on Win32
	* updated docs about Windows XP SP2
	* sumiserv checks pack number

2004-09-08 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>
	* broadcasting - send to multiple clients simultaneously (beta),
	  this paves the way for multicast support (not yet implemented)
	* ack timeout set to rwinsz*5 (for slower connections)

2004-09-07 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net> - 0.8.7
	* fix KeyError: broadcast bug in sumiserv (Asuran)
	* validate client IP address in sumiserv (microbrew)
	* client resolves DNS names to IP addresses for myip
	* data carousel implemented for multicast, but still needs testing

	* last release until I have more time to continue working on SUMI

2004-09-04 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>
	* password and local address now required for running rawproxd
	* maximum retries default set to 3 (changed from 5)
	* server no-ack timeout set to rwinsz*3 (from rwinsz*2),
	  works better on laggy IRC servers
	* broadcast support added to rawproxd

2004-09-03 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net> - 0.8.5
	* rawproxd allows a password to connect, making it more secure

2004-09-02 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>
	* rawproxd.c working, raw proxy support added to sumiserv
	  (works on a Linksys WRT54GS router!)
	* rawproxd.cpp obsoleted due to new protocol format
	* .lost suffix changed to .sumi
	* Resuming seems to finally work correctly now
	* Fixed 100% CPU + excess flood bug involving lost packets
	  (found by microbrew - thanks)
	* Fixed overestimated client timeout, saves bandwidth
	* sumigetw explicitedly aborts transfers when closing instead of
	  waiting for them to time out on the server

2004-08-31 Dan Weber <dan@mirrorlynx.com>
	* Rewrote strings.txt in strings.texi,  I want to start a
	  process of rewriting documentation in texinfo

2004-08-31 Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>
	* ChangeLog converted to GNU style, old version in ChangeLog.old

2004-08-29 Dan Weber <dan@mirrorlynx.com>
