Resuming SUMI Created:20040222

Resuming a transfer is necessary in every file transfer program. SUMI should
store:

+ offset at which no packets were received yet
+ currently lost packets behind the offset

to do: everything identifying the transfer
- "IRC" + IRC server + channel (where to go)
  + channel key if needed     <- are the channel+key needed? if has to join
- nickname of server           (what to send to)
- filename                     (what to send)

With this, the lost files can have a .sumi extension, clicking them in Win32
will open SUMI, use the transport to connect, (join), send, receive and resume
the file. Data file is always <basename> if resume file is <basename>.sumi.

Would be useful. The .sumi files could even be sent around if the offset & lost
packets are zeroed (offset=1, lost packets=[]). If <basename> doesn't exist,
it can be ignored and the transfer could start over, resuming to the .sumi.

Just like .torrent files.
