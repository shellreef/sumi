<h1>SUMI Anonymous File Transfer</h1>
<p><a href="http://sf.net/projects/sumi">SUMI</a> is a new file sharing
program that aims for total anonymity for the uploader. It is a work in 
progress; although anonymous file transfer works there are some rough edges.

<p>Developers: the 
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/sumi/sumi/">latest source</a>
is now in <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/sumi/sumi/">CVS</a>.
Patches welcome!

<p>Official IRC channel is #sumi at irc.liquidirc.com, key anon. LiquidIRC was
chosen because it anonymizes the hostmask automatically. Sample files are 
served here, though you can also chat and ask questions.

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=113628">Download here</a> - 0.8 released 2004-08-20
<p><a href="ss.html">Screenshots here</a>.

<h2>SUMI Client GUI Mini-HOWTO</h2>
<p>If you want to try out SUMI, this tentative guide may help. If you have
any questions or get stuck, feel free to ask for help in the channel or via
email.

<ol>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sumi">Download</a> and unpack
the latest release to a directory of your choice. 
<li>Proceed to 
<a href="#windows">SUMI Mini-HOWTO for Windows</a> or
<a href="#unix">SUMI Mini-HOWTO for Unix</a> depending on your OS. Continue
below after completing the Windows- or Unix- specific steps.<p>
<li><a name="continue">Welcome back</a>. In your IRC client, type
<tt>/server irc.liquidirc.com</tt> and then
<tt>/join #sumi anon</tt>. 
<li>Feel free to say hi. The developers have a ! or @ in front of their name,
the servers +.
<li>To download a small sample file, use 
<tt>/sumi get sumi-00 #3</tt>. If this works, wait for sumi-00 to list and
download the other, larger files if you want to. All the files offered on this
bot are believed to be legal to distribute. If you get "No such nick", make
sure that sumi-00 is signed on -- sometimes it is not available.
<li>If you're so inclined, try to discover the true source of the files from
sumi-00. If SUMI is performing as intended, the source should be anonymous.
If not, please contact a developer.
<li>Setup your own SUMI server! For starters, edit <tt>sumiserv.cfg</tt> to suit
your needs (sharing the files you wish to, etc.), and run
<tt>python sumiserv.py</tt>. This step is more involved, if you require any
assistance feel free to ask in the channel.
<li>Enjoy anonymous serving!
</ol>

<a name="windows"><h2>SUMI Mini-HOWTO for Windows</h2></a>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="http://www.mirc.com/">mIRC</a>.
<li>Run the included sumiinst.exe installer.
<li>Make sure you have mIRC integration selected. Proceed with the installation.
If you don't have SUMI mIRC already installed, it should popup a dialog saying
its about to install, and install itself to your Aliases.ini.
<li>If you installed SUMI to a directory other than
<tt>C:\Program Files\SUMI</tt>, open Aliases.ini
(usually in <tt>C:\Program Files\mIRC</tt>) and edit the run line to match
the real location of <tt>sumigetw</tt>.
<li><a href="#continue">Continue here</a>
</ol>

<a name="unix"><h2>SUMI Mini-HOWTO for Unix</h2></a>
<ol>
<li>You need <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>. Install it however
is normal to do so on your OS.
<li>Install <a href="http://xchat.org/">Xchat</a>, at least version 2. 
Alternatively, install
<a href="http://pyirclib.sourceforge.net/">irclib</a>, but xchat2 is preferred.
<li>Edit <tt>client-side/xchat.pl</tt> so that the <tt>$SGW_PATH</tt> points
to where you placed <tt>sumigetw.py</tt>.
<li>Start xchat, then go to the menu item X-Chat -&gt; Load Plugin or Script, 
navigate to <tt>sumi/client-side/xchat.pl</tt> and load it. Optionally, use
<tt>cp sumi/client-side/xchat.pl ~/.xchat2/sumi.pl</tt> if you want to autoload
the SUMI script whenever xchat starts.
<li>xchat should say "SUMI xchat2 transport loading".
<li><a href="#continue">Continue here</a>.
