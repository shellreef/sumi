<h1>SUMI Anonymous File Transfer</h1>
<p><a href="http://sf.net/projects/sumi">SUMI</a> is a new file sharing
program that aims for total anonymity for the uploader. It is a work in 
progress; although anonymous file transfer works there are some rough edges.

<p>Developers: the 
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/sumi/sumi/">latest source</a>
is now in CVS. Patches welcome!

<p>Official IRC channel is #sumi at irc.liquidirc.com, key anon. LiquidIRC was
chosen because it anonymizes the hostmask automatically, for example this is
my whois information:
