<h1>Configuring SUMI</h1>
<p>SUMI comes in two parts: server (sumiserv) and client (sumiget). This
page will describe the configuration of both components.

<h1>Configuring The SUMI Client (sumiget)</h1>

<tr>
 <td><b>dl_dir</b></td>
 <td>Where to save downloaded files - must end in a / (or \ for win32)</td>
</tr><tr>
 <td><b>myip, myport</b></td>
 <td>Your IP and your port - these must be INTERNET ACCESSIBLE! That means
     use your public IP, and forward a UDP port on your router if needed.
 If data_chan_type is UDP, myport is a 16-bit UDP port; if ICMP, myport is
a two packed 8-bit type and code values, equal to type*0x100+code,
see <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters">ICMP parameters</a>.
<p>Note that SUMI downloaders are not anonymous, only uploaders.

         TODO: Make myport configurable, attempt to read myip from the
          network interfaces. Local IPs are bad, as they indicate they will
          be translated by a NAT most likely, so warn and offer to use real IP
          but with EXTREME CAUTION.
<p>       TODO: While we're at it, also get netmask and offer to use it
        <a href="http://tgolden.sc.sabren.com/python/wmi_cookbook.html#ip_addresses">link</a>
          has WMI to get IP and MACs of IP-enabled network devices, can
          use ioctl for BSD. However, making a remote connection and using
          the local sockname works better.</p>
</tr><tr>
 <td><b>mss</b></td>
 <td>    MSS = MTU - IP_header(20 bytes) - UDP header(8 bytes)<br>
         Most minimal: MTU 552, MSS=524 (still not that bad)<br>
         MIN: Hosts required to handle 576 byte IP datagrams, 548 byte payload<br>
         With VLAN/tunnel headers, MSS<=1450<br>
         On Ethernet, MTU=1500, MSS=1472<br>
         MAX: 65535 - 28 = 65,507 (excluding jumbo payload option)<br>
         We don't want fragmentation -- makes packets much more fragile.<br>

         <p>IMPORTANT:UDP MSS is not TCP MSS! UDP MSS is 12 bytes larger because
         of UDP's smaller headers (8 vs 20). Keep this in mind for best
         efficiency.

 <td><b>rwinsz</b></td></td>
 <td>         RWINSZ - Receive window size. This is the number of SECONDS
         before acking. This value is also used as the number of seconds before
 updating the speed.</td>
</tr><tr>
 <td><b>bandwidth</b></td>
 <td>Our DL bandwidth in bits/sec. From this value, the sender will calculate
         the packet send delay as to not overwhelm our bandwidth. If this
         is set to higher than your real bandwidth, packets may be lost and
         it will be slower. Note that sender may have less bandwidth.
         <ul><li>1500000 = 1.5Mbps</ul></td>
</tr><tr>
 <td><b>data_chan_type,</b></td>
 <td>Data channel type. UDP is default. For ICMP, i with code=0 and type=0 is the echo
     reply and it will work best for passing through firewalls.
<ul>
<li>u is UDP
<li>i is arbitrary ICMP
<li>e is ICMP echo mode (bounce off a gateway)
