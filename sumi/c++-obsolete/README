Version 0.2 of SUMI (20030729) was a reimplementation of sumiserv in C++,
ported from the original Perl. This C++ version added raw sockets. Come
0.4, the C++ version was superseded with the SUMI Python implementation.

To build, type make.

One useful utility that came out of SUMI C++ was "launch", a C++ setuid
program to create a raw socket and pass it to a program via envars. It
still remains above this directory.
